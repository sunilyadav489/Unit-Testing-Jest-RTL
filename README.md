# Unit Testing with Jest and React Testing Library


## Jest
Jest is a JavaScript Testing Framework that allows developers to run tests on JavaScript/TypeScript code and can be easily integrated with React JS, Angular, Vue, Node and more!

## React Testing Library
React Testing Library (RTL) is a library for testing React applications. React Testing Library focuses on testing components from the end-user's experience rather than testing the implementation and logic of the underlying React components.

### `npm run build`
